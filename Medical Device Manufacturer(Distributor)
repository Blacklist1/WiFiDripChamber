  Most of the hospitals nowadays purchase the medical devices through ordering the products they need by 
the other specialized companies, instead of buying themselves. 
Due to the development of the internet and related technologies, one of the most common system that the hospitals use is 
Electronic Requisition System. The hospitals electronically order the medical devices and then the companies handle 
the whole process of obtaining apt products within set price.


The companies like Medline(http://www.medline.com/) are usually both the manufacturer and the distributor of the medical supplies.
