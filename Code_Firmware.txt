/* 
PROBLEMS: AppScript doesn't know when to search, or PULL from the spark core and "see" that it's dripping.
		Also, if the AppScript pulls too frequently, it may register a single drop twice.
		
		Possible solutions would be to record the no. of drips over a 10, 30, or 60 second interval, and 
		storing the drips per minute in a Spark.variable "dripsPerMinute"
		This variable can then be accessed by the web, in resolutions of 10, 30, or 60 seconds, with 
		less accuracy for "higher" resolutions.

		Please include other possible solutions or include implementations in a separate file.
